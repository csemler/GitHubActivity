Beginning（Chris Semler）
When Johnny woke up one morning, he knew something felt different.
The birds' song didn't sound like it used to, and the sky didn't appear as blue.
However, he figured it was just his imagination and decided to get ready for his online class.
When he reached for his laptop, he realized the worst has happened: the WiFi was not connected.
Middle（Weijie Zhou）
Johnny did everything he could to try to connect to the network。However，the network failed to restart.
He take out his phone, then figured out that cell phone signals also disappear.
"What's happening!" he said.
Then He decided to ascertain the cause of these intentions.
Johnny got outside for asking his friend for finding out the truth.
End (Dawson Bauer)
Johnny found out that everyone in the world didn't have cell phone signals. He realized the world
could no longer use phones. At first everyone was panicking, but then people realized it wasn't all
bad. There started being way more human interactions. People were talking to each other face
to face. People were going outside more. There wasn't social media dragging everyone's feet and
making everyone feel lazy. In the end, it was actually a good thing that happened.
